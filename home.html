			<p><h2> About Luxury car </h2></p>
			<p>There is no certain vehicle type when it comes to luxury vehicles. Drivers can find luxury vehicles in all categories including sedans, hatchbacks, crossovers, SUVs and even minivans. It doesn’t necessarily matter how much the vehicle costs either, which is where this gets tricky. What it comes down to is that even if an automaker considers a certain model to be a luxury vehicle, that doesn’t mean all drivers will agree.</p>

			<p>What it comes down to is that there is no clear definition of what makes a luxury vehicle, luxury. It’s mostly in the eye of the beholder, but there are still those well-known brands that hold on to the luxury definition even as it changes through the years. We’re going to highlight some features that drivers may argue are considered to be ‘luxury’. Check it out below:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Heated steering wheel</li>
				<li>Integrated seat massagers</li>
				<li>Water-resistant windows</li>
				<li>Automatic safety features</li>
				<li>Entertainment systems</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are just a few features that come to mind when we think of what defines a luxury vehicle. Of course these features don’t automatically make a vehicle luxury, but it’s a step in that direction.
